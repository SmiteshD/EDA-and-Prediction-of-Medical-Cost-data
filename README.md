# EDA-and-Prediction-of-Medical-Cost-data

This project aims to predict medical costs using the Medical Cost Personal Dataset. The dataset contains information about individuals' healthcare costs and insurance claims, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, region, and medical charges.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the 'Medical Cost Personal Dataset', which consists of 1338 instances and 7 features. It provides a comprehensive set of variables that can be utilized to explore the factors affecting medical costs and predict insurance charges.

## Project Overview

In this project, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, understand the relationships between variables, and identify any patterns or trends. We then used linear regression to develop a predictive model for estimating medical costs based on personal characteristics.

## Repository Structure

- `insurance/`: This directory contains the dataset file.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for EDA, data preprocessing, and model training.
